This presentation aims to develop an optimized regularization model for Mr. John Hughes to predict heating load in energy-efficient buildings. The dataset contains 768 observations and 9 variables: 8 independent variables (Relative Compactness, Surface Area, Wall Area, Roof Area, overall height, Orientation, Glazing Area, Glazing Area Distribution) and 1 dependent variable (Heating Load).
Accurate prediction of heating load is crucial for optimizing energy consumption, reducing costs, and minimizing environmental impact. To achieve this, we will create three regularization models—LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net—using Python in Jupyter Notebook. These models help prevent overfitting and enhance prediction accuracy by adding penalties to the model complexity. For each model, we will present three key insights based on Adjusted R², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics evaluate the model’s performance, with higher Adjusted R² and lower MAE and RMSE indicating better accuracy. Finally, we will recommend the best-performing model for Mr. Hughes and suggest two actionable steps to further enhance its usability. This approach ensures a robust and practical solution for predicting heating load, aiding in better energy management.
