Mr. John Hughes has been analyzing the diamonds dataset, which contains detailed information about diamonds, including carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and dimensions (length, width, depth). The main goal is to create a reliable multivariate regression model using these features to predict diamond prices accurately. This model will assist in understanding how different elements affect the price and provide information about the pricing strategies of diamonds. Using statistical approaches and OneHotEncoding to translate categorical characteristics into numerical values, the model seeks to offer high precision and reliability, facilitating data-driven decision-making to optimize diamond pricing. The dataset consists of 10 variables and 53,940 observations, with the dependent variable being a price in USD. After this analysis, Mr. Hughes will receive crucial insights into the relationships between the independent and dependent variables within the regression model. Additionally, he will be provided with recommendations that can assist in making more informed decisions and gaining a deeper understanding of the data.
